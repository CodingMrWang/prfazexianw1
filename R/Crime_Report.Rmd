install package from github
```{r}
devtools::install_github("CodingMrWang/prfazexianw1", Force = TRUE)
library(prfazexianw1)
```

load the data with a foor loop
```{r}
require(data.table)
require(ggplot2)
require(readxl)
require(cowplot)
filenames <- list.files("data")
crime_idx <- grep("crime-statistics", filenames)
crime_files <- filenames[crime_idx]
number_of_files <- length(crime_files)
crime <- vector(mode = "list", length = 10)

for (i in seq_along(crime_files)) {
  f <- crime_files[i]
  crime[[i]] <- setDT(read_excel(file.path("data", f)))
  
  setnames(crime[[i]], c("date", "suburb", "postcode", "offence_level_1",
                    "offence_level_2", "offence_level_3", "offence_count"))

}

```


Draw five graphs together to make comparision 
```{r}

```
From the graph, we can observe that the total offence in Adelaide is always larger than that in ABERFOYLE PARK. 





```{r}
knitr::kable
library("knitr")
offence_description = "OFFENCES AGAINST PROPERTY"
suburbs = c("ABERFOYLE PARK", "ADELAIDE")
d1 <- crime[[1]][(crime[[1]]$suburb %in% suburbs & crime[[1]]$offence_level_3 %in% offence_description),
                          list("total_offence_count" = sum(offence_count)),by = list(month(date), suburb)]
d2 <- crime[[2]][(crime[[2]]$suburb %in% suburbs & crime[[2]]$offence_level_3 %in% offence_description),
                          list("total_offence_count" = sum(offence_count)),by = list(month(date), suburb)]
d3 <- crime[[3]][(crime[[3]]$suburb %in% suburbs & crime[[3]]$offence_level_3 %in% offence_description),
                          list("total_offence_count" = sum(offence_count)),by = list(month(date), suburb)]
d4 <- crime[[4]][(crime[[4]]$suburb %in% suburbs & crime[[4]]$offence_level_3 %in% offence_description),
                         list("total_offence_count" = sum(offence_count)),by = list(month(date), suburb)]
d5 <- crime[[5]][(crime[[5]]$suburb %in% suburbs & crime[[5]]$offence_level_3 %in% offence_description),
                          list("total_offence_count" = sum(offence_count)),by = list(month(date), suburb)]
d = rbind(d1, d2, d3, d4, d5)
kable(d)
